## Version Control

Think of version control like a time machine for your projects. Every time you make changes, it quietly saves a snapshot so you can go back if something breaks or if you just liked an earlier version better. It’s especially handy when working with others—no more messy email attachments or “final_v3_really_final” file names. Everyone can work on the same project without stepping on each other’s toes.

## Git

Git is the actual tool that makes this time machine possible. It runs on your computer and remembers every change you make to your code. What makes Git extra powerful is that it gives each person their own complete copy of the project, so you don’t have to worry about being offline or messing up the main work. You can branch off to try something new, and if it works, merge it back. If it doesn’t, no worries—just toss it away and you haven’t broken anything.

## Git vs GitHub

Here’s where people often mix things up. Git is the tool; GitHub is the place. GitHub is like a big online hub where you can put your Git projects, show them off, and invite others to join in. Without GitHub, Git still works fine on your own computer, but with GitHub you get collaboration, backup, and community. So in short: Git helps you manage your project, and GitHub helps you share it with the world.
